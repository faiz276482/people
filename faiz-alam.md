## Bio

Hi, I am Faiz Alam, a student at Netaji Subhash Engineering College. Currently in my 3rd year, Btech course in the field of IT. My journey with DSC NSEC began when our lead asked me to join his core team. I am also one of the lead Graphics Designer at DSC. By being in the core team I learnt a lot in the field of designing as the requirements for each event are different and we had to come up with something innovative for each of the events. I am also a machine learning and Android enthusiast.

I am a very optimistic person with a zeal for life. I can speak in 4 languages and can code in proficiently in 3(C, Python, Java). I have 3 years of experience in web development and web designing. Currently, I am learning android app development and data science with python.

I like to keep myself busy always so that I won't get distracted. I am really very hardworking and I tend to complete my task in hand before time. I have done a ton of jobs for many companies and individuals as well.

I have been freelancing in my part time at fiverr.com for 5 years now with over 170+ 5star reviews. I have been keenly interested in the field of machine learning and I will be pursuing that for time being.
